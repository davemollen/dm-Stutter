## VST3, CLAP, AUv2 & LV2 installation

You can download the VST3, CLAP, AUv2 & LV2 plugins from the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Stutter/releases).

The LV2 plugin doesn't have a GUI unless you run the plugin in MOD Desktop.

On macOS you may need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/) as Apple has recently made it more difficult to run unsigned code on macOS.

## MOD installation

Install the plugin from the MOD Audio plugin store.

The latest MOD builds can also be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/davemollen/dm-Stutter/releases).

If you want to build the plugin on your own machine check out the [mod-plugin-builder repository](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder) for instructions.
